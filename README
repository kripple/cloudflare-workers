# Cloudflare Workers

This project is built using Cloudflare Workers.

## Development

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

The development server will be accessible at `http://localhost:8787/`.

### Regenerate Type Definitions

After adding bindings, you can regenerate a type definition for the `Env` object by running the following command:

```bash
npm run typegen
```

This ensures that your code has accurate type information for the resources you've bound to your worker.

## Deployment

The `main` branch is deployed automatically.
