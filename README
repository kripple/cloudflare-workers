# Cloudflare Workers

This project is built using Cloudflare Workers.

## Development

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once the development server is running, open a browser tab and navigate to `http://localhost:8787/` to see your worker in action.

### Regenerate Type Definitions

After adding bindings, you can regenerate a type definition for the `Env` object by running the following command:

```bash
npm run cf-typegen
```

This ensures that your code has accurate type information for the resources you've bound to your worker.

## Deployment

To deploy your worker to Cloudflare, run the following command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```
